# X UI Clone

This is a high-fidelity, static front-end clone of the X (formerly Twitter) user interface. It is built purely with **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS**.

The project meticulously replicates the three-column layout of the main feed page, serving as an excellent case study for advanced Tailwind CSS usage, responsive design, and custom theme configuration.

-----

## Features

This static clone visually represents the core X UI, including:

  * **Responsive Three-Column Layout**: The layout adapts smoothly from mobile to large desktop screens using Tailwind's responsive breakpoints.
  * **Left Navigation Sidebar**:
      * Icon-only and expanded views for navigation links (Home, Explore, Notifications, Messages, etc.).
      * "Post" button.
      * User profile section at the bottom.
  * **Main Content Feed**:
      * Sticky header with "For You" and "Following" tabs.
      * "What's happening?" tweet composition box.
      * A scrollable feed populated with static sample posts, complete with user info, images, and action icons (reply, repost, like, etc.).
  * **Right Discovery Sidebar**:
      * Sticky "Search" bar.
      * "Subscribe to Premium" promotional card.
      * "Today's News" card.
      * "What's happening" card for trends.
      * "Who to Follow" suggestions card.

*Note: This is a static project for visual demonstration. All links, buttons, and input fields are non-functional.*

## Tech Stack

  * **HTML5**: Provides the semantic structure for the web page.
  * **Tailwind CSS**: Used for all styling, from basic layout and typography to complex, responsive components.
  * **npm**: Used as a package manager to handle the Tailwind CSS dependency.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

This project utilizes a well-structured Tailwind setup:

  * **`src/input.css`**: This is the main source file for styling.
      * `@import "tailwindcss"`: Imports Tailwind's base, component, and utility layers.
      * `@theme`: Defines a custom theme, including:
          * **Custom Fonts**: Configures the "Chirp" font family (the actual X font).
          * **Custom Colors**: Defines project-specific colors like `--color-primary`, `--color-disabled`, and various hover-state colors.
          * **Custom Breakpoints**: Adds a `vsm` (very small) breakpoint.
      * `@layer components`: Uses `@apply` to create custom, reusable component classes like `.side-items` and `.post-footer-icons`.
  * **`package.json`**:
      * Includes a `build` script to compile the CSS.
      * `"build": "npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch"`.
  * **`src/output.css`**: The compiled, production-ready CSS file that is linked in `index.html`.
